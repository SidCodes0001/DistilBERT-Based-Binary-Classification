# DistilBERT-Based-Binary-Classification


## Objective 
To build state of the art text classifier using Hugging Face's Transformers library.

## Steps

- Install and import necessary libraries
- Select dataset(in this case taken from hugging face itself) 
- Select model in this case (distilbert-base-uncased)
- Then perform preprocessing steps like tokenization using auto tokenizer.
- Set training arguments
- Train & evaluate your model on your dataset
- Now happily make predictions.
